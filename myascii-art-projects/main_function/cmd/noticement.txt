If you are going to run this code at cmd directory, then you should change the file paths, which are written in the code, for openning the banner files.
Just changed to "../banner/" and also change the checking part's path where needs to check the original file's key to "../check/file_key/".
The fails, which needs regarding changes are: comparing_hash.go(Comparing_hash function), obrabotka.go(Reading_file function)
